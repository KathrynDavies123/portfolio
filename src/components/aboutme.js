            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>With many years' experience working in customer service and account management, I recently decided on a career change into web development. I studied in a 7 month part-time front-end bootcamp with Supercode and since then I have been developing my skills by completing various projects. </p>
            <p>I am ready to jump into my first role as a Junior or take on my first freelance project. Please feel free to reach out to me with any enquiries.</p>
